# blah2

A real-time radar which can support various SDR platforms. See a live instance at [http://radar4.30hours.dev](http://radar4.30hours.dev).

![blah2 example display](./example.png "blah2")

## Features

- 2 channel processing for a reference and surveillance signal.
- Designed to be used with external RF source (for passive radar or active radar).
- Outputs delay-Doppler maps to a web front-end.
- Record raw IQ data by pressing spacebar on the web front-end.
- Saves delay-Doppler maps in a JSON array.

## SDR Support

- [SDRplay RSPDuo](https://www.sdrplay.com/rspduo/).
- [USRP](https://www.ettus.com/products/) (only tested on the B210).
- 2x [HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) with clock synchronisation and hardware trigger.
- 2x [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) with clock synchronisation.
- [KrakenSDR](https://www.krakenrf.com/) with 2x channels only.

## Services

The system runs three services:

- The radar processor responsible for IQ capture and processing.
- The API middleware responsible for reading TCP ports for delay-Doppler map data, and exposing this on a REST API.
- The web front-end displaying processed radar data via nginx.

## Usage

Install on a bare-metal system (tested on Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo git clone http://github.com/30hours/blah2 /opt/blah2
cd /opt/blah2
sudo chown -R $USER .
sudo ./bare-metal/install.sh      # packages, vcpkg, Node.js, nginx, systemd
sudo ./bare-metal/install-sdr.sh  # SDR drivers, cmake build, deploy
```

Edit `config/config.yml` for desired processing parameters, then start:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/blah2/bare-metal/start-blah2.sh
```

The radar processing output is available on [http://localhost](http://localhost).

## Documentation

- See `doxygen` pages hosted at [http://doc.30hours.dev/blah2](http://doc.30hours.dev/blah2).

## Future Work

- Support for the HackRF/RTL-SDR using a front-end mixer, to sample 2 RF channels in 1 stream.
- Support for the Kraken SDR with all 5 channels.
- Add [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR) support for the [C++ API](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki/Cpp_API_Example) to include a wide range of SDR platforms.

## FAQ

- If the SDRplay RSPduo does not capture data, restart the API service using `sudo systemctl restart sdrplay`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome - especially for adding support for a new SDR.

- Currently have an issue where the USRP B210 is timing out after 5-10 mins and crashes the code. Convinced it's an issue with my usage of the API - contact me for more info.
